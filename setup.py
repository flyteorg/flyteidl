        # Packages in here should rarely be pinned. This is because these
        # packages (at the specified version) are required for project
        # consuming this library. By pinning to a specific version you are the
        # number of projects that can consume this or forcing them to
        # upgrade/downgrade any dependencies pinned here in their project.
        #
        # Generally packages listed here are pinned to a major version range.
        #
        # e.g.
        # Python FooBar package for foobaring
        # pyfoobar>=1.0, <2.0
        #
        # This will allow for any consuming projects to use this library as
        # long as they have a version of pyfoobar equal to or greater than 1.x
        # and less than 2.x installed.
