// The difference between these settings and the WorkflowMetadata ones is that these are meant to be passed down to a workflow's underlying entities (like tasks). For instance, 'interruptible' has no meaning at the workflow layer, it is only relevant when a task executes. The settings here are the defaults that are passed to all nodes unless explicitly overridden at the node layer. If you are adding a setting that applies to both the Workflow itself, and everything underneath it, it should be added to both this object and the WorkflowMetadata object above.
type CoreWorkflowMetadataDefaults struct {
	// Whether child nodes of the workflow are interruptible.
	Interruptible bool `json:"interruptible,omitempty"`
}
