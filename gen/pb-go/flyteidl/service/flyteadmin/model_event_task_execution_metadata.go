package flyteadmin

// Holds metadata around how a task was executed. As a task transitions across event phases during execution some attributes, such its generated name, generated external resources, and more may grow in size but not change necessarily based on the phase transition that sparked the event update. Metadata is a container for these attributes across the task execution lifecycle.
type EventTaskExecutionMetadata struct {
	// Unique, generated name for this task execution used by the backend.
	GeneratedName string `json:"generated_name,omitempty"`
	// Additional data on external resources on other back-ends or platforms (e.g. Hive, Qubole, etc) launched by this task execution.
	ExternalResources []EventExternalResourceInfo `json:"external_resources,omitempty"`
	// Includes additional data on concurrent resource management used during execution.. This is a repeated field because a plugin can request multiple resource allocations during execution.
	ResourcePoolInfo []EventResourcePoolInfo `json:"resource_pool_info,omitempty"`
	// The identifier of the plugin used to execute this task.
	PluginIdentifier string `json:"plugin_identifier,omitempty"`
