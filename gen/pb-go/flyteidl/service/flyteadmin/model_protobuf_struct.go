// `Struct` represents a structured data value, consisting of fields which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, `Struct` might be supported by a native representation. For example, in scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an object. The details of that representation are described together with the proto support for the language.  The JSON representation for `Struct` is JSON object.
type ProtobufStruct struct {
	// Unordered map of dynamically typed values.
	Fields map[string]ProtobufValue `json:"fields,omitempty"`
