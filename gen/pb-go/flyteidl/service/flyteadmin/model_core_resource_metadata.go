	// Selection of GPU accelerators currently involves using node selectors and/or tolerations to schedule a given workload on the right node group. Given that these are attributes of the pod, and not directly associated with the primary container's resource specification (the `nvidia.com/gpu` resource name is used across accelerators), we pass this request through as resource metadata instead.
